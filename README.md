# Slack Clone

A modern Slack-inspired chat application showcasing **Partial Prerendering (PPR)** with **Cache Components** and real-time message simulation. Built with Next.js 16, React 19, and TanStack Query.

## Features

### Real-time Experience
- **Live message injection** - Messages appear every 5-15 seconds across all channels with realistic users and content
- **Progress indicator** - Visual countdown showing when the next message will arrive

### Modern Architecture
- **Partial Prerendering (PPR)** - Static content loads instantly, dynamic content streams in
- **Cache Components** - Server Components with `"use cache"` for optimal performance
- **Hybrid data architecture** - Server Components seed data, TanStack Query manages client state

- **Real-time state management** - Global message injection works across navigation

### User Experience
